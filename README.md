#Ionic2/Electron Starter Project

While it seemed straightforward to do this at first, there were a few quirks that made me create this repo in case I have to do it again. It saves a few hours.

So using Ionic2 and Electron you can build applications using Ionic2/Angular2 in one code base that compiles into applications for:

- Windows
- OSX
- Linux
- Android
- IOS

It's a work in progress. So feel free to fork and do pull requests.
